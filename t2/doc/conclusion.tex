\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\paragraph{}
\par As for the first lab experiment, the values for current in branches, voltage in nodes and the equivalent resistance calculated through the simulation made with Ngspice and the theorical analysis with nodal method in Octave tools were in perfect harmony. The differences between the obtained values are negletible. This is due to the fact that the circuit is also linear, because the capacitor is a linear element. 
\par We can agree that the assignment was completed with success.
